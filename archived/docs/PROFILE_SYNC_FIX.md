# Profile Sync Fix - Implementation Summary

## Problem Identified

Users were not being synced to the Supabase `profiles` table because:

1. **Incorrect Webhook URL**: The Clerk webhook was initially pointing to a staging/preview URL (`emoji-maker-7gli-i2cegb8dk-srozmey-projects.vercel.app`) instead of the production URL (`https://emoji-maker-7gli.vercel.app/`)
2. **Failed Webhook Deliveries**: 5+ webhook attempts failed, visible in your Clerk dashboard
3. **Missing Profiles**: Users who signed up during this period don't have profiles in Supabase

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created Profile Sync API Endpoint
**File**: `app/api/profile/sync/route.ts`

This endpoint:
- Authenticates the user via Clerk
- Checks if a profile exists in Supabase
- Creates a profile with default values if it doesn't exist (3 credits, 'free' tier)
- Returns the profile data or creation status

### 2. Created Profile Sync Utility
**File**: `lib/profile-sync.ts`

This utility provides:
- `syncUserProfile()`: Calls the sync API and handles the response
- `ensureUserProfile()`: Simple wrapper for easy integration
- Proper error handling and logging

### 3. Integrated into Main App
**File**: `app/page.tsx` (modified)

Changes:
- Added `useUser` hook from Clerk to track authentication state
- Added profile sync on component mount
- Sync runs automatically when user is signed in
- Updates credits from synced profile
- Loads emojis and folders only after profile is synced

## How It Works

### For New Users (after webhook fix)
1. User signs up ‚Üí Clerk webhook fires ‚Üí Profile created in Supabase ‚úÖ
2. User visits app ‚Üí Profile sync checks ‚Üí Profile exists ‚Üí Continue normally ‚úÖ

### For Existing Users (who signed up during webhook issue)
1. User visits app ‚Üí Profile sync checks ‚Üí Profile doesn't exist
2. Profile sync creates profile automatically with default values ‚úÖ
3. User can now use the app normally ‚úÖ

## Testing Instructions

### Test 1: Verify Webhook is Now Working

1. **Check Clerk Dashboard**:
   - Go to Clerk Dashboard ‚Üí Webhooks ‚Üí Your webhook endpoint
   - Verify URL is set to: `https://emoji-maker-7gli.vercel.app/api/webhooks/clerk`
   - ‚úÖ URL should match your production domain

2. **Test New User Signup**:
   ```bash
   # Open browser console to see logs
   # Sign up with a new test account
   # After signup, check browser console for:
   # "Syncing user profile..."
   # "‚úÖ Profile already exists" (if webhook worked)
   ```

3. **Verify in Supabase**:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM profiles ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 5;
   ```
   - New user should appear in profiles table
   - Credits should be 3
   - Tier should be 'free'

### Test 2: Verify Existing Users Get Profiles

1. **Sign in with an existing user** (who signed up during webhook issue)

2. **Check browser console**:
   ```
   Syncing user profile...
   ‚úÖ New profile created for user
   ```

3. **Verify in Supabase**:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM profiles WHERE user_id = 'user_xxx';
   ```
   - Profile should now exist for this user

### Test 3: Retry Failed Webhooks (Optional)

1. Go to Clerk Dashboard ‚Üí Webhooks ‚Üí Your endpoint
2. Click on "Message Attempts" tab
3. Find failed `user.created` events
4. Click the three dots ‚Üí "Retry"
5. This will automatically create profiles for those users

## What to Monitor

### Browser Console Logs
- `"Syncing user profile..."` - Profile sync initiated
- `"‚úÖ New profile created for user"` - Profile was missing and got created
- `"‚úÖ Profile already exists"` - Profile already in database
- `"‚ùå Failed to sync profile:"` - Error occurred (investigate!)

### Supabase Database
```sql
-- Check all profiles
SELECT user_id, credits, tier, created_at 
FROM profiles 
ORDER BY created_at DESC;

-- Count total profiles
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM profiles;
```

### Clerk Webhook Dashboard
- Monitor "Delivery Stats" bar
- Should see more "SENDING" (blue) and fewer "FAIL" (red)
- New signups should have successful webhook deliveries

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### New User Flow
1. User signs up on Clerk ‚Üí Webhook creates profile in Supabase
2. User redirected to app ‚Üí Profile sync confirms profile exists
3. Credits and folders load correctly
4. User can generate emojis

### Existing User Flow (without profile)
1. User signs in to app
2. Profile sync detects missing profile
3. Profile created automatically with 3 free credits
4. User can now generate emojis

## Rollback Instructions

If you need to rollback these changes:

1. Remove profile sync from `app/page.tsx`:
   ```typescript
   // Remove these lines:
   import { syncUserProfile } from '@/lib/profile-sync';
   const { isLoaded, isSignedIn, user } = useUser();
   const [profileSynced, setProfileSynced] = useState(false);
   
   // Remove the profile sync useEffect
   // Restore original useEffect for loading emojis/folders
   ```

2. Delete new files:
   - `app/api/profile/sync/route.ts`
   - `lib/profile-sync.ts`

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ **Verify webhook URL** in Clerk Dashboard
2. ‚úÖ **Deploy to production** (if not already deployed)
3. üîÑ **Test with a new signup** to confirm webhook works
4. üîÑ **Test with existing user** to confirm profile gets created
5. üìä **Monitor logs** for 24-48 hours to ensure stability

## Additional Improvements (Future)

Consider implementing:
- Database trigger to auto-create profiles when emojis are generated
- Admin dashboard to see all users and their profiles
- Email notification when profile is created
- Better error handling for profile creation failures
- Rate limiting on profile sync endpoint

## Support

If issues persist:
1. Check Supabase logs for database errors
2. Check Vercel logs for API errors
3. Check Clerk webhook logs for delivery failures
4. Verify environment variables are set correctly in Vercel

**Implementation completed**: ‚úÖ Profile sync mechanism in place
**Testing required**: üîÑ User to verify with real signups
**Status**: Ready for production testing
