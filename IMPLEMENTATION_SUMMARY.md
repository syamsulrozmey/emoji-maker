# Folders Feature Implementation Summary

## âœ… Completed

All tasks from the plan have been successfully implemented:

### 1. Database Schema âœ…
Created two new Supabase tables:
- **`folders`** - Stores user-specific folders/categories
- **`emoji_folders`** - Junction table for user-specific emoji-to-folder assignments

SQL script provided in: `supabase_folders_schema.sql`

### 2. API Routes âœ…

**Created `/app/api/folders/route.ts`** with:
- `GET` - Fetch all user folders
- `POST` - Create new folder
- `PUT` - Rename folder
- `DELETE` - Delete folder

**Created `/app/api/emojis/[id]/folder/route.ts`** with:
- `PATCH` - Assign/unassign emoji to folder for current user

**Updated `/app/api/emojis/route.ts`**:
- Modified GET to fetch emoji-folder assignments for the current user
- Added folder_id to response data

### 3. Frontend Updates âœ…

**Updated `app/page.tsx`**:
- Replaced localStorage with API calls for folders
- Added `fetchFolders()` function to load folders from database
- Updated `handleCreateFolder()` to call POST /api/folders
- Updated `handleRenameFolder()` to call PUT /api/folders
- Updated `handleDeleteFolder()` to call DELETE /api/folders
- Updated `handleAssignEmojiToFolder()` to call PATCH /api/emojis/[id]/folder
- Removed all localStorage code
- Updated `fetchEmojis()` to handle folder_id from API

**Updated `types/emoji.ts`**:
- Updated Folder interface to use UUID from database instead of timestamp-based IDs
- Updated interface to match database schema (user_id, created_at)

### 4. Documentation âœ…
- Created `FOLDERS_SETUP.md` - Comprehensive setup guide
- Created `supabase_folders_schema.sql` - Database schema script
- Updated `requirements/backend_instructions.md` - Added folders documentation

## Build Status

âœ… Build completed successfully with no errors or warnings

All new API routes are registered:
- `/api/folders`
- `/api/emojis/[id]/folder`

## Key Features

âœ¨ **User-Specific Folders**: Each user has their own separate set of folders
âœ¨ **User-Specific Assignments**: Same emoji can be organized differently by different users
âœ¨ **Database Persistence**: All folder data is stored in Supabase (no localStorage)
âœ¨ **Cascade Deletion**: Deleting a folder automatically removes emoji assignments
âœ¨ **Authentication**: All operations are protected by Clerk authentication
âœ¨ **Optimized Queries**: Indexes added for better performance

## Next Steps

To use this feature, you need to:

1. **Run the SQL script in Supabase**:
   - Open Supabase SQL Editor
   - Copy contents from `supabase_folders_schema.sql`
   - Execute the script

2. **Test the feature**:
   - Start dev server: `npm run dev`
   - Sign in with Clerk
   - Create folders using "Add folder" button
   - Assign emojis to folders
   - Test rename and delete operations

3. **Verify persistence**:
   - Refresh page - folders should remain
   - Sign out and back in - folders should remain
   - Clear browser cache - folders should remain (stored in database!)

## Files Changed

### New Files Created:
- `app/api/folders/route.ts`
- `app/api/emojis/[id]/folder/route.ts`
- `supabase_folders_schema.sql`
- `FOLDERS_SETUP.md`
- `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` (this file)

### Files Modified:
- `app/api/emojis/route.ts` - Added folder assignments to response
- `app/page.tsx` - Replaced localStorage with API calls
- `types/emoji.ts` - Updated Folder interface
- `requirements/backend_instructions.md` - Added folders documentation

## Technical Details

### Database Design
- UUID primary keys for folders
- User-specific folders via `user_id` column
- Junction table for many-to-many relationship (emojis â†” folders)
- UNIQUE constraint ensures one folder per emoji per user
- CASCADE delete for cleanup

### API Design
- RESTful endpoints
- Proper HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH)
- Authentication via Clerk
- Error handling and validation
- Consistent JSON response format

### Frontend Design
- Async/await for all API calls
- Optimistic UI updates where appropriate
- Error handling with user feedback
- State management with React hooks
- Clean separation of concerns

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Run `supabase_folders_schema.sql` in Supabase
- [ ] Start development server
- [ ] Sign in with Clerk
- [ ] Create a folder
- [ ] Assign emoji to folder
- [ ] Rename folder
- [ ] Delete folder
- [ ] Verify persistence after page refresh
- [ ] Test with multiple users (folders should be separate)

## Troubleshooting

See `FOLDERS_SETUP.md` for detailed troubleshooting guide.
