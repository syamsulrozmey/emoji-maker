## Key Metrics & Business Logic

### Credit Costs
- Trial: 5 credits (one-time, $0.0375 cost to you)
- Starter Pack: 30 credits for $4.99 (~$4.44 profit)
- Pro Pack: 75 credits for $9.99 (~$8.83 profit)
- Pro Monthly: 15 credits/month for $3.99/month (~$3.68 profit)

### Replicate Budget
- Cost per generation: ~$0.0075
- Daily budget: $5/day = ~667 generations
- Max trial users/day: ~130 users

### Credit Behavior
- Trial credits: Never expire, one-time allocation
- One-time purchases: Never expire
- Monthly subscription: 15 credits added each billing cycle
- Credit deduction: FIFO (oldest credits used first)
